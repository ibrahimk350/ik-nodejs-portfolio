							<b>Project Description:</b>
							<br> 
							This project initially got started as a companion app for my portfolio website. The more I developed this app, the more I realized that
							there are students just like me who would love to showcase their projects in their resume(s). The traditional resumes just don't allow for
							such a thing. Hence, I came up with the idea to make an app where people can integrate their projects with their resumes. More features include 
							searching for another student and being able to see their profile. Adding other students to your network. Being able to update your information on the fly.
							With the click of one button, have your resume downloaded to your phone anytime and anywhere. There are alot of students that can benefit from such an app.
