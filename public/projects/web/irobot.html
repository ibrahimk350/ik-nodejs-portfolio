							<b>Project Description:</b>
							<br>
							This project was simply built in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It was a personal project which I developed in my free time.
							This website features a CSS3 based dropdown menu along with a custom image/content slider. It also features 6 custom modules
							on the front page. Funtionality to search through the entire website is also present. Ability to sign up for newletters is also
							an option that can be enabled/disabled. All the pages come with standard two columns layout.
							The left column is used for content while the right column is used for custom widgets.
							It also comes with custom made image popup box. Lastly, the website also features full width page which can be used for contact etc.</p>
