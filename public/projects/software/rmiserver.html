							<b>Project Description:</b>
							<br> 
							This project was built in Java using Eclipse.
							It was a simple RMI server. One computer was used to run the RMI Server.
							The rest of 25 computers were used as clients and as each computer connected to the server,
							they all requested a specific file download simultaneously. Every client had the file downloaded
							from the server and then were disconnected. The end point of this project was to explore Java
							remote method invocation, also known as RMI.</p>
