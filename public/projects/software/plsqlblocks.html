							<b>Project Description:</b>
							<br> 
							Advanced Database Programming allowed me to otimize databases for production uses.
							It also allowed me to extend my knowledge from basic sql queries to advanced sql queries optimized
							for performance and security. In the above screen shot, I have duplicated a company's database
							which has a lot of employees. For every employee that is either updated or inserted, a trigger
							fires which takes that newly created employee and adds it into the audditable table automatically.
							There are also functions, triggers and events that gets triggered every time a query is executed against
							the database. </p>
